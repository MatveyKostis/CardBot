Just change it in "WAIT_INTERVAL"

## Bot says that i'm not admin!
Maybe you forgot to enter your telegram ID in "AUTHORIZED_USERS"
(WARNING: ID mean not @(USERNAME) It's mean that search in google how to find it)

## A console says "raise InvalidToken("You must pass the token you received from https://t.me/Botfather!"telegram.error.InvalidToken: You must pass the token you received from https://t.me/Botfather!")
You need to make a bot and take a token! Enter the https://t.me/Botfather and make the bot
